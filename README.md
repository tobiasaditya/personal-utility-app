# personal-utility-app

This app is made out of boredom. I had made two projects this last 3 months : Personal Transaction App and IoT Project

In earlier version for personal transaction, I don't really put any effort on User Interface. Well, not because I don't want to, but I never learn UI.

And for IoT, I used an ESP-32 connected to Blynk. As for early version, i still used a telegram bot to receive the data on command.

Then i made a decision to make an app, containing both projects but with better UI and UX on Android.

This is just a self note.
